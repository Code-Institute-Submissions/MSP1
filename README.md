# Milestone Project 1

A website built to showcase what i've learned so far in the Code Institutes Full Stack Developer Course.
This particular website is a personal portfolio page.

## UX

This website was built for potential employers to get a quick and easy overview of me.
It was designed for ease of use, the layout is minimilist, but appealing making it easy and enjoyable to navigate.
All information is kept, short and straight to the point to make it more digestable to the reader.
All buttons and calls to action have hover effects to let the user know they are useable and look more appealing.
Main Content area has an eyecatching animation to grab the users attention.

attatched is a link to a wireframe i mocked up as a base for my website
[a relative link](wireframe/Portfolio-wireframe.pdf) 

## Features

* NavBar- includes a navbar brand and elements, all linked to certain parts of the page, which allows easy navigation for the user.
* Main Content- includes name, download cv, contact button and a call to action to scroll down the page to see more.
* About section- includes a few small paragraphs explaining what i do, how i do it, and why to hire me.
* skills section- lists a few skills i possess and a progress bar for visual effect.
* work section- a few cards with images and a brief overview of each site, allows to user to click a view each website in a new tab keeping the user on the origin page.
* contact section- provides the user with a small bit of personal info and also a contact form if they wish to work with me.
* Footer- a section with various social links for the user to browse.

## Technologies Used

* BootStrap- I used bootstrap in this project to help give basic layout and responsiveness.
 i also used some components such as modal and contact form from the documentation and styled with my own css.
A link to the page can be found here - https://getbootstrap.com/

* Font Awesome- I used Font Awesome to add some appealing icons to my page, such as the social links and the arrow button in the main content.
A link to the page can be found here- https://fontawesome.com/

* Google Fonts- I used Google Fonts as a reliable way to import the fonts i wanted to use in my project.
As matt says, if we can't connect to google servers we have more things to be worried about ;)

## Testing

### Responsiveness

To test this i used Developer tools, two phones, and an external user (a friends phone).
on both developer tools and one of my phone the page responded well and everything worked as it should.
However on my phone and my friends phone (Galaxy s9 and Galaxy s8 respectively) the headers for each section were partially display off-screen.
I believe this was due to these phones having beveled edges.
To solve this issue i used a media query to remove padding and center align the headings which pulled the headings in nicely.


### Contact form

1. Go to the "Contact" section of the page
2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

### links

Click any button or link on the page and it will work correctly and as it should.


## Deployment

I used GitHub Pages to deploy my webpage, and other pages that are linked on the website.

To do this i went to each corresponding repository, went into settings, scrolled down to GitHub Pages, slected the master brach,
and github provides a link to where the page is hosted.

## Credits

### Content

* About/Skills section- I used the about and skills info from the Rosie Résumé page made by Code Institute.

* Animation- The highlighting animation used on my name made using CSS and HTML came from a youtube video which i tweaked slightly to what i desired.
